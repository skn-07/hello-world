# hello-world
Just learning how to use Git, GitHub and also trying to become a better programmer. This is my first repository and I'm learning some GitHub basics with the help of GitHub Guides.

Okay. So, Now I've learned how to create branches and why do I need branches. I've created my first branch and now I'm making some changes. These changes will only reflect on my current branch and not in my master branch. Now, I will commit(Save) this changes.
